## Career path

I have started my career with a number of summer and student jobs. Towards the end of highschool I have started a career as a coach of child basketball teams and have finished it at the end of my master studies. During this time I have also co-founded a small IT startup, where we have developed applications for athletes. I have also joined a student organisation AIESEC where I was the graphics designer. After my masters I have started my career as a software developer in Simfin d.o.o. where I have gained experience in a structured environment and a fast paced and competitive industry. Due to my extensive time as a basketball player, I am at home when it comes to team work and I am a fast learner who can quickly gain new knowledge and skills and I always persevere until the job is done.

__My free time__ *Unity Game developer*  
With the help of online resources, I learned game development in Unity, despite having no knowledge about it but a great desire and drive to learn. In these years I've finished a couple of smaller games, some during game jams. I've learned a great deal about the Unity software, coding in C#, drawing pixel art, 3d modelling, game design, creating/editing audio and video editing. All of my projects I've completed on my own and I've done every part of them. You can take a look at my projects and my journey on my website [buckyside.com](http://buckyside.com), where you can also find links to my YouTube channel and other social media where you can find all of my content.
